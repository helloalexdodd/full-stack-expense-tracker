## For the Front End

In the client directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

after initial download, and run:

### `npm run dev`

to run the front end of this application in development mode.

## For the Back End

In the server directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

after initial download, and run:

### `npm run dev`

to run the back end of this application in development mode. You will also need to connect to a Mongo Database in order to record any activity locally.

You will also need to create environment variables for the email and password if you want to test the Forgot Password functionality locally. If you run into any errors on the server check `server/logger/logfile.log` for the latest errors.
